The Center of Internet Security offers benchmarks against which to test a Kubernetes cluster. Rancher has integrated CIS scans and can mitigate the findings.

The CIS Benchmarks cover the CIS Controls v8 4.1, which we could map to the relevant chapters in the Network and Information Systems Directive II.

As NIS2 matures, we hope to see formal mappings with CIS Controls v8 and its Implementation Groups to ease practical implementation.

Upcoming legislation, such as the KRITIS-DachG ("Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie (EU) 2022/2557 und zur St√§rkung der Resilienz von Betreibern kritischer Anlagen"), will further strengthen the security posture of IT systems in the EU.

Regardless of future developments, governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance will remain critical topics in Enterprise IT, and the CIS Benchmarks are a good tool for monitoring compliance.

Happy Ranching!
